## ESP-WIFI-MESH HANDS-ON
Hi, this is all about [ESP32 - MESH](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/mesh.html)!
ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth, manufactured by [ESPRESSIF](https://www.espressif.com/):rocket:
```
\o 
ESP-WIFI-MESH is specifically designed 
for ESP32 chips. These chips use the 
modified version of dual-core based FreeRTOS 
and have an official development framework, 
which is called ESP-IDF

and Tinker too, and eventually you may *toss me some feedback* :blush:

Here, the emphasy lies on this motto of the Maker Movement: :art:
```
Learning By Doing!
``` 

I believe that the essential lessons can be learned about the systems - about the world - 
from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interenting things.

These are the [Levy, Steven(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396)'s **Hackers Ethic** principles (that I've valued most):
* *Access to computer* - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always *yield to Hands-on Imperative*!
* *Hackers should be judged by their hacking*, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position;
* You can *create art and beauty* on a computer;
* Computer can *change your life for the better*.
